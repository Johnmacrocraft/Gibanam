# Gibanam


**Gibanam** is an add-on (resource pack) created to improve the Korean translation of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. It is based on fromgate's [Translations for Minecraft](https://github.com/fromgate/TranslationsForMinecraft).

This project enhances translation quality by:

- Adopting the Korean translations from Minecraft: Java Edition. Translations for Java Edition are managed by the community on Crowdin, but most of them are better than those done by professional translators for Bedrock Edition.
- Completely retranslating strings to correct errors and resolve inconsistencies in the existing translations.


## Installation
First, download the repository as a ZIP file by clicking [here](https://github.com/Johnmacrocraft/Gibanam/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

After downloading, extract the file and move the resulting `Gibanam` folder (which may be inside the `Gibanam-master` folder) to the game's resource pack folder. You can delete `README.md`.


## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the translation, please do not submit pull requests to this repository that modify the translations of Java Edition. Instead, submit your translations to the [Java Edition Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft).


## Others
If you find this project useful, please consider voting for [this issue](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-176901) on the Mojang Issue Tracker.

Due to the way the game works, you need to add this resource pack to the world's resource packs if you want to apply the chemistry and editor translations. Also, this resource pack does not modify the translations for Marketplace content and achievements.
